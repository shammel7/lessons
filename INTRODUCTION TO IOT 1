* CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
* REAL-TIME ANALYTICS
* ACTIONABLE DATA
* INDUSTRY-WIDE CONNECTIVITY


What is IoT?
- IoT is a network of interconnected objects (things) that are embedded with sensors, actuators, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
- IoT is the intersection of the Internet, Things and Data.
- IoT collects that data from millions of sensors embedded in everything from cars, to refrigerators, to space capsules.


IoT HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
- In 1990
The term Internet of Things was coined by Kevin Ashton when he was working for Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999.
- Later on in 2002
Forbes published an article also entitled Internet of Things.


WHAT ARE THE “THINGS”?
It is important to note that the word THING has a special meaning in IoT. In the context of IoT, a thing is any physical object that can connect to the Internet.


“SMART” things
In the context of the Internet of Things, the adjective “smart” means anything that is IoT-based.


HARDWARE FOR IOT

FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS OF IoT
* Sensing
* Communication
* Computing
* Acting

* SENSORS *
- It measures physical input from the surroundings and converts it into electrical signal (Analog or Digital) 
- Integration with microprocessor/microcontroller embedded system.
- Example in Smartphone – (GPS, Fingerprint, Tilt, camera, etc.)
- The size of sensors is very compact due to advancements in technology
- The choice of sensor is based on accuracy, precision, level of intelligence, and the need of the application.


* COMMON TYPES OF SENSOR *

* Temperature sensor
- detects the temperature of an object or an environment. 
Used for: Thermostats, digital thermometers, etc.

* Proximity sensor
- detects motion Used for: alarm systems, parking sensors etc

* Optical sensor
- converts light energy into digital signals Used for: digital cameras

* Pressure sensor
- converts physical power into electronic signals
Used for: touch screen devices

* Humidity sensor
- measures the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere
Used for: weather related IoT Devices

* Accelerometer
- measure acceleration Used for: running apps, navigation

* Gyroscope
- uses Earth’s gravity to detect the position or 
orientation of an object Used for: 3d motion capture


* ACTUATORS *
- After receiving input from its environment, smart objects can then react or perform appropriate actions. This is done using actuators. An actuator is a component or mechanism that turns energy into motion. Basically, actuators comprise the “moving parts” of a smart object. For example, actuators in a CCTV camera allows the user to point it to different directions.
- While sensors, sense; actuators act
- Cause an action, to control the situation
- To make something happen based on the trigger, actuators are used
- Control signal could be analog or digital.
- To turn something on or off Actuators are used

* TYPES OF ACTUATORS * 

01. HYDRAULIC
- These actuators harness hydraulic power to perform mechanical functions and operations. Generally, these types of actuators are powered by a cylinder or a fluid motor. According to the requirements and recommendations, the mechanical motion is converted into oscillatory, linear, or rotary.

02. PNEUMATIC
- Pneumatic actuators create two types of motions, rotary or linear. They are powered by a vacuum or compressed air at high pressure to implement the required type of motion. Compared to other types of actuators, pneumatic actuators are low-cost and low-maintenance actuators.

03. ELECTRICAL
- In these actuators, a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical motion. These actuators are powered by electricity and provide precision control. These actuators are heavily used in industrial settings to automate mechanical operations

04. THERMAL
- The thermal actuators have thermal-sensitive material fitted inside, which is used to produce linear motion. The word thermal implies that these actuators are used in response to temperature changes. The most popular use case includes shutting off valves and operating latches or switches.

05. MAGNETIC
- These types of actuators convert electromagnetic energy into mechanical output and operate in a linear or rotary direction. Magnetic actuators can provide continuous mechanical operation and are popularly used in the automotive and aerospace industries.


* Connectivity & Gateway *

Roles of Connectivity Protocols
- It plays a crucial role in connecting sensors and actuators with IoT ecosystem
- Based on medium and range, various protocols are available
- Examples, Cellular, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, etc,


GATEWAY
- It provides an effective communication bridge in between edge devices and IoT cloud

ROLES OF GATEWAY
-Ensures seamless communications
- Easy management of data traffic
- Offers security
- Latest encryption practices

To make or break a deal (Based on processed data)
-Latency cannot be compromised (For real-time 
applications)
IoT cloud is the brain of IoT ecosystem
-Edge computing (it is used for local processing)


IoT analytics and Data management
* Data Extraction
* Data Analytics
* Data Aggregation
* Data Classification


IoT analytics and Data management

- Data is the fuel for IoT applications
- Converting raw data into useful insights
- Data extraction, data aggregation, data classification are the major tasks of IoT Analytics and data management
- Deep Learning (It can be for data prediction for some application)
- Storage power and intelligent computation are key parameters of IoT analytics and data management

User Interface

- It can also send back the command to the field of devices
- It might provide user with an actual live feed or show trends

CONTROLLER
- a connected device implementing an
algorithm to transform input data in actions.
