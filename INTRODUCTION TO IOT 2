                                       Internet of Things


Reasons of IoT
> Data deluge : The explosion of theamount of data collected andexchanged is one of the major reason why IoT came in existence. Forecasts indicate that in the year 2015 more than 220 Exabytes of data are stored. So we need novel mechanisms to find, fetch, and transmit data.
> There is decrease in energy required tooperate intelligent devices. The search will be for a zero level of entropy where the device or system will have to harvest its own energy. 
> Miniaturization of devices: the devices are becoming increasingly smaller.
> Autonomic management: the devices/systems of future will have selfmanagement, self-healing, and selfconfiguration capabilities.
> IPv6 as an integration layer: allows to exploit the potential of IPv6 and related standards.

01. IoT ARCHITECTURE
IoT design choices: The full spectrum of various levels of IoT architecture from the sensor to the cloud and back.


* Requirements for IoT Architecture 
- IoT Architecture is a set of standards and layers that will group the requirements of different devices, actuators, and protocols. In order to pave the way for fascinating IoT Applications, the IoT Architecture needs to consist of the following:

01. Distributed open architecture with end to end characteristics, interoperability of heterogeneous systems, neutral access, clear layering and resilience to physical network disruption

02. Decentralized autonomicarchitectures based on peering of nodes.

03. Architectures moving intelligence at edge of the networks, up to users’ terminals and things

04. Cloud computing technology, event-driven architectures, disconnected operations and synchronization.

05. Use of market mechanisms for increased competition and participation. 


* IOT MODELS *
- To be able to come up with a well-structured IoT architecture, the first step would be to review the existing IoT reference architectures proposed by different organizations as follows:

01. IIRA
- The Industrial Internet Consortium has delivered the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA), with a strong industry focus specifically on industrial IoT applications (Shi-Wan et al., 2017).

02. IoT-A EU
- The Internet of Things IoT-A EU initiative delivered a detailed architecture and model from the functional and information perspectives (Carrez, 2017).

03. RAMI 4.0
- The Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) goes beyond IoT, adding manufacturing and logistics details. This is effectively a reference architecture for smart factories dedicated to IoT standards that started in Germany (Platform-i40.de, 2018).

04. IEEE P2413 
- The IEEE P2413 project formed a working group dedicated to the IoT’s architectural framework, highlighting protection, security, privacy and safety issues (Soo, 2016).


IoT Reference Architecture
* IoT Applications
* IoT Management Service Platform
* IoT Network
* IoT Devices Sensors and Actuators


* COMMON FEATURES *

01. Physical devices: The “things” in the IoT
02. The gateway: A border module to link resourcelimited devices
03. Applications: Data processing and analytics, for example
04. Integration: A protocol to allow communication between nodes and servers


Layer 1 – Physical Layer (Device Layer)
- In this layer, devices such as sensors are used to capture parameters about the environment and to convert those into signals. Also in this layer, actuators are being used for the process of automation to perform any mechanical processes. Communication between the devices and servers can happen in two ways.

- Either each device communicate directly to the servers using protocols such as REST, MQQT, XMPP or AMQP (explained in next topic);

- Or they communicate indirectly through a gateway. This will allow devices to just capture parameters and send them to the gateway through short-range communication protocols like Zigbee, Bluetooth and RF. The gateway wouldthen combine the received the messages and transmit to the required server. The goal is to garner enough interest from investors so that they are motivated to invest in the business.


Layer 2 – Gateway Layer
- In this layer, gathering of data from various devices is the main requirement. It performs translation of various messages received from heterogeneous devices and sends the leverage data using protocols mentioned. Apart from doing the receiving and sending of data, it can also provide services like data filtering, cleanup, aggregation and packet content inspection. 


Layer 3 - Integration Layer
- Most of the time this layer is hosted in the cloud; however it could also be a dedicated server. This layer would be responsible for the collection of data from the gateways and storing in such way that they can be queried and processed. That is why the cloud is the preferred host as they also provided data redundancy. Examples are Apache Kafka, ThinkSpeed, Microsoft Azure (IoT). 


Layer 4 - Application Layer
- Finally, the Application Layer is responsible for the presenting the data collected, processed and labelled in such a way that it hides the complexities and is more inductive to users. In this layer, the data can be further enriched by applying machine learning algorithms and predictions can be made and presented to users. Presentation of final results can be through website or mobile apps. Examples of such platforms are IBM’s Bluemix, Apache Spark, and so on.


Building Blocks Of IoT Architecture
- The Internet of Things denotes the connection of devices, machines, and sensors to the Internet. An IoT system comprises four basic building blocks: sensors, processors, gateways, and applications.



The architecture of IoT components:

* Sensors
- convert a non-electrical input to an electrical signal. Sensors are classified into two types: active and passive sensors. Whereas active sensors use and emit their own energy to collect real-time data (ex.: GPS, X-ray, radars), passive sensors use energy from external sources (ex: cameras). Additionally, sensors differentiate themselves by position, occupancy, and motion, velocity and acceleration, force, pressure, flow, humidity, light, radiation, temperature, etc.

* Processors
- are the brain, the main part of the IoT system. They process the raw data captured by the sensors and extract valuable information. Examples of processors are microcontrollers and microcomputers.

* Gateways
- are the combination of hardware and software used to connect one network to another. Gateways are responsible for bridging sensor nodes with the external Internet or World Wide Web.

* Applications
- provide a user interface and effective utilization of the data collected.



IoT Networking
- The actual TCP/IP networking model has 4
layers with protocols defined at each layer.
However since IoT has its own specificity,
different protocols have emerged at each layer to suit it. They are presented in Figure:


                        IoT and TCP/IP

|                   | /LoRaWAN            |
-------------------------------------------

Layer 1 (Link Layer)

* Wifi (Wireless Fidelity)
- latest version can cover up to 400m and can provide bandwidth up to about 1 Gbps.
* Bluetooth
- can have a data rate up to 3 Mbps and maximum range of 100m.
* ZigBee
- works in the 2.4 GHz with a data rate of 250 Kbps and up to 200m or range. It also supports AES encryption.
* WiMax
- can cover large area up to 50 km (fix device) and 15 km (mobile device) and can provide a bandwidth up to 40 Mbps.
* Cellular (2G/3G/4G)
- provide worldwide coverage and varying bandwidth. However operational costs are higher.
* Others
- (less popular) include WirelessHart, DigiMesh, NFC, ANT, LoRaWAN, …


Layers 2 and 3 (Network and Transport Layer)
- look at the communication protocols which includes routing (choosing optimal path) and providing reliability (retransmission). Some existing protocols are being used, while some new ones have also seen the day.


Layers 2 and 3 (Network and Transport Layer)

01. IPv6 - is the upgraded version of IPv4, which could not cope with boom of ip addresses demand. IPv6 can provide 1 IP address per cm2. It also has other features such as encryption and simple header (less overhead). 

02. 6LoWPAN - is the acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. “It is an adaption layer for IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4 links. This protocol operates only in the 2.4 GHz frequency range with 250 kbps transfer rate" (Postscapes.com, 2017).

03. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - is used an as alternative to TCP (reliable delivery), that provides performance tuned for realtime applications. However UDP does not provide reliability; therefore this  aspect has to be addressed in higher level protocols.

04. Others include QUIC, Aeron, DTLS, NanoIP, CCN and TSMP.



Layer 4 (Application Layer)
– concerns the data protocols, that is, specific for the application it is meant for. In this layer, the predominant protocol is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which is still used by a lot of IoT Systems. However, some new protocols have also been implemented. 

Layer 4 (Application Layer)

* HTTP
- mainly designed for web browsers, it also important for IoT as it supports the REST API which is becoming the main mechanism for Web Applications and services to communicate. However HTTP comes with a lot of overhead.

* MQTT
- (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) "The MQTT protocol enables a publish/subscribe messaging model in an extremely lightweight way. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium" (Postscapes.com, 2017).

* AMQP
- (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) uses TCP/IP and publishes subscribe model and Point to Point

* COAP
- (Constrained Application Protocol) "is an application layer protocol that is intended for use in resource-constrained internet devices, such as WSN nodes. CoAP is designed to easily translate to HTTP for simplified integration with the web, while also meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity” (Postscapes.com, 2017).

* AMQP
- Others include SMCP, XMPP, DDS, LLAP, Web Sockets and SOAP



How are the networks changing?

* Extensions
– More nodes, more connections
– Any TIME, Any PLACE + Any THING
– M2M, IoT
• Billions of interconnected devices,
• Everybody is connected

* Expansions
– Broadband

A review of 2023 IoT challenges and advances
● Building more semiconductor manufacturing plants in Asia, North America and Europe. Creating shorter supply chains for semiconductors should help avoid future issues with the chips needed to develop IoT applications.

● Many companies are working to accelerate the rate at which IoT-derived data can be analyzed and turned into useful insights in data centers and at the edge. And with more IoT devices collecting data, there's more data for analysis and training



MARKET TRENDS

IoT growth drivers in 2024 and beyond 
In the coming year, the following areas will likely be the main contributors to IoT growth.

1. More AI support for IoT 
  According to the IEEE survey, respondents indicated that the top four potential applications of AI in 2024 will be real-time cybersecurity vulnerability identification and attack prevention, increased supply chain and warehouse automation efficiencies, accelerated software development and more automated customer service. Increasing supply chain and warehouse efficiencies will also require significant investments in IoT technology to enable product identification, handling and development.

2. More widespread connectivity for IoT devices 
  A May 2023 report from IoT Analytics, "State of IoT -- Spring 2023," projected that by 2025, the growth of IoT devices could increase to 27 billion connected IoT devices. A trend that will enable this growth is the increased replacement of 2G/3G wireless networks with 4G/5G networks. This will particularly increase connectivity in urban communities, but many rural areas will still depend upon lower performing networks.

3. Lower costs for IoT product components 
  Other chips saw oversupply in 2023, including dynamic RAM (DRAM) and NAND flash memories, which led to lower prices. Lower prices and a greater availability of components going into 2024 will result in lower costs for endpoint IoT products, which could accelerate further adoption.

4. New technological developments 
  IoT is attracting many new technological developments that will drive growth in 2024 and beyond. These developments include changes incomputer architectures -- driven in part by changes in storage and memory approaches -- that will affect the way data is stored and processed in data centers and at the network edge. This will result in less data movement and lower-power data processing.

5. System disaggregation enabling more efficient data processing 
  Disaggregation of traditional data center servers and composing virtual computing systems enable more efficient processing of data as well as lower power consumption and more sustainable computing. Much of the data processed in data centers is from IoT applications, and as IoT grows, this processing will also grow. Non-volatile memory express (NVMe), Compute Express Link (CXL) and the changes they enable in computer architecture will reduce the costs of many IoT applications.

6. New chip design and standards 
  In 2022, a standard called Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) was introduced that aimed to enable specialized chips from many manufacturers to be combined together in a compact package. This enables the creation of more specialized semiconductor chiplet packages for special applications and creates the need for a new type of foundry for assembling chiplets into a UCIe package. UCIe will enable more efficient semiconductor devices for data centers, the network edge and for IoT endpoint devices.

7. Emerging non-volatile or persistent memory technologies for IoT
  In addition to traditional memory technologies, there are emerging non-volatile or persistent memory technologies that are starting to show up in IoT devices, particularly for code storage in designs under 28 nm. For instance, magnetic RAM (MRAM) and resistive RAM (RRAM) are used in some consumer IoT devices, such as wearables. Replacing static RAM with a non-volatile memory, such as MRAM, enables more lower-power states when the IoT device is not being actively used. For energyconstrained applications, such as those running on batteries, this increases the usefulness and life of a charge for the IoT device

● A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
comprises many sensor nodes, each of which has sensors that can identify a wide range of physical phenomena, including pressure, heat, light, and more. With the rapid technical advancement of sensors, WSNs will become the core technology for IoT.
• These sensors may capture a wide range of information, from location data to device orientation. Together, these sensors provide a considerable amount of data, both unstructured (such as images and movies) and organized (like GPS coordinates or acceleration readings). These sensor nodes are always linked to the internet through Wi-Fi, 3G, or 4G, ensuring a steady flow of data.


Cloud Computing
● Cloud computing is another important IoT-enabling technology. Massive amounts of data are generated by IoTdevices. Cloud solutions offer scalable and dependable storage and processing for this data. They offer data analysis, remote device administration, and secure access to information from anywhere. The cloud computing industry is dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides a wide range of dependable, scalable, and affordable cloud computing services. As of 2023, AWS is a one-stop solution for various cloud services, from data storage to analytics.


THREE MAIN TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING

01. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
- IaaS offers virtualized computer resources over the Internet. Users can pay-as-you-go for virtual machines, storage, and networking. It makes it suitable for tasks like hosting websites and running development environments.

02. Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- PaaS offers a platform that enables developers to create, test, and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It delivers a platform that includes operating systems, development tools, and databases. It speeds up the development process and is perfect for teams working on software.

03. Software as a Service (SaaS):
- SaaS provides ready-to-use software applications over the Internet. These applications may be accessed by users via web browsers without the need to install or maintain them locally. Common examples include Gmail, Microsoft 365, etc. SaaS is userfriendly and streamlines software management.



Big Data Analytics
● Big data analytics is the process of inspecting large volumes of data to reveal valuable insights, patterns, correlations, and trends. Organizations can use this analytical approach to make data-informed decisions. It entails the use of statistical analytic techniques, such as clustering and regression, to large datasets using modern tools and technologies. These analyses can uncover hidden patterns, market trends, consumer behaviours, and other useful information in structured and unstructured data sources, such as streaming and batch data.

Real-World Examples
* Facebook
- 100 TB/day
* Youtube
- 48, 000 fresh videos daily
* Linkedin
- 10TB on a daily basis
* twitter
- 400M tweets/day

Embedded Systems
● Embedded systems, such as microcontrollers and other hardware components, are critical in processing sensor data. The information gathered by these sensors isn't immediately usable. Instead, the embedded system intervenes to make it useful.
