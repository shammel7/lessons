Internet of Things (IoT) with Arduino


ARDUINO
- is a microcontroller-based platform that consists of open-source hardware, software, 
and programming tools. The concept of the Arduino ecosystem revolves around 
simplicity, making microcontrollers more accessible to the general public and great educational aids.


* THE BIRTH OF ARDUINO *

- Created in 2003

- By a group of academics at the Interaction 
Design Institute in Ivrea, Italy

- The platform was named after a bar in the same
town where the academics met to discuss the project.

- One of the project's goals was to remove the barrier of entry 
for students who wanted to realize automation ideas but 
did not have enough resources to purchase expensive 
controllers or knowledge to build their printed circuit boards


* They decided to design their own circuit board
- Massimo Banzi & David Cuartielles

* Designed the programming language for the board.
- David Mellis


ARDUINO is the go-to gear for artists, hobbyists, 
students, and anyone with a gadgetry dream.


ARDUINO REACHED WORLDWIDE

ARDUINO has found tremendous success as an 
educational tool, as many universities worldwide have 
adopted it as a way to introduce students to control automation.



WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH ARDUINO?
⏣ Make a line-following robot
⏣ Make a fluffy toy that lights up
⏣ Make your phone ring when you receive an e-mail
⏣ Make a Metroid-style arm cannon
⏣ Make a coffee maker that sounds an alarm when your coffee is ready
⏣ Make device that can record your heart rate when you ride your bike

DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARDUINO
* Boarduino Kit
* Arduino LilyPad
* Arduino Uno
* DIY Arduino
* Arduino Mega 2560



* ARDUINO UNO *

What does it have?
• 14 Digital In/Out pins (6 can be used as PWM 
(Pulse Width Modulation)
• 6 Analog Inputs
• A USB Connection
• A Power Jack
• Reset Button
• On-board LED
• SCL/SDA pins (Serial Clock/ Serial Data pins)

In short, it contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; 
simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a 
AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.


DIGITAL
- Microcontrollers are digital devices – ON or OFF. Also called – discrete.

ANALOG
- Analog signals are anything that can be a full range of values.


ANALOG VS DIGITAL

Analog Sensors

| Sensor         | Variable         |
|----------------|-----------------|
| mic            | soundVolume     |
| Photoresistor  | lightLevel      |
| Potentiometer  | dialPosition    |
| Temp Sensor    | temperature     |
| FlexSensor     | blend           |
| Accelerometer  | tilt/acceleration |

Digital Sensors
•Digital sensors are more straight forward than Analog.
•No matter what the sensor there are only two settings: On and Off
•Example, Push button, Switch


SERIAL COMMUNICATION

01. “Serial” because data is broken into bits, each sent 
one after another in a single wire.

02. Uploading sends the bits through USB 
cable to the Arduino

03. Compiling turns your program into 
binary data (ones and zeros)

04. The two LEDs near the USB connector blink when data is transmitted.
• RX blinks when the Arduino is Receiving data.
• TX blinks when the Arduino is Transmitting data


Why is Serial Communication Important in Arduino?

* Sensor Integration
- Many sensors and modules used with Arduino communicate via serial 
protocols. This allows you to collect data from various sensors 
and process it on your Arduino board.

* External Control
- Serial communication enables you to control your Arduino 
from a computer or another microcontroller. This is 
essential for remote monitoring and control applications.

* Debugging and Monitoring
- Serial communication provides a way to send debugging 
information and monitor the operation of your Arduino 
code, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
